## About Me

California-born, North Carolina-raised, and Army-trained, I returned to my roots at NC State University in 2021 after enjoying 27 years as an Army intelligence officer. With the completion of an M.Ed. in Learning Design & Technology, I've jumped back into the DoD technology modernization space. My military career was focused on analyzing information to inform decision-makers. I’m taking that experience and applying it to the evolving, fast-paced ecosystem of information system integration for those that need it most, our defense service members. My goal is to deliver disruptive technology solutions that enable more effective intelligence, cyber, and communication capabilities as our nation’s defenders prepare for the geopolitical challenges of the coming decade.

**Professional and research interests include:**
<ul>
  <li>Inquiry – Employing data science models to better understand how to recognize and mitigate misinformation</li>
  <li>Design – Integrating technology to personalize learning and measure performance</li>
  <li>Leadership – Strengthening digital literacy to enhance organizational learning</li>
</ul>
