## My Goals

California-born, North Carolina-raised, and Army-trained, I’m returning to my roots at NC State University after enjoying 27 years as an Army intelligence officer. This time around my passion is education as I’m working to complete an M.Ed. in Learning Design & Technology. My military career was focused on analyzing information to inform decision-makers. I’m now taking that experience and applying it to the evolving field of learning technology. At a young age, I was blessed with incredibly talented and selfless teachers. My goal through this program is to develop tools that will continue to enable great teachers to guide students just as I was. From the K-12 community through higher ed and into industry, my objective is to create accessible and engaging educational spaces in which students become lifelong scholars with an eye toward improving the world around them.

**Professional and research interests include:**
<ul>
  <li>Inquiry – Employing data science models to improve learning metrics</li>
  <li>Design – Integrating technology to personalize learning</li>
  <li>Leadership – Strengthening digital literacy to enhance organizational learning</li>
</ul>

My primary goal as I transition to the next phase of my journey is to make a positive change in the world of learning. Whether that’s analyzing methods and outcomes, assisting colleagues in integrating technology into their curricula, or helping organizations transform into more advanced learning environments, my passion is in education. Whichever path I choose, I will base my educational philosophy on sound learning theories that incorporate creative design principles while integrating the most effective technologies that I’ve been exposed to in NC State’s Learning Design and Technology program. To achieve this goal, I’ve structured my M.Ed. studies to focus on the **Inquiry** strand of the program while building supporting skills in **Design** and **Digital Leadership**. Half of my coursework (5 courses) is directed at researching and evaluating learning technology programs to better identify metrics for student success. That strong technical evaluation focus is reinforced by a broad knowledge of applying instructional technologies to developing learning programs (3 courses), and leading organizations through digital transformation (2 courses). This coursework along with the practical experience gained in the military and an analytics lab internship has provided me with the appropriate knowledge and confidence to apply data science methods to improve learning design and technology integration in K-12, post-secondary, and industry educational environments.

**Inquiry**
In the Spring of ’22, I complete the coursework to receive a graduate certificate in Learning Analytics. This program was comprised of 12 credit hours over two consecutive semesters and focused on developing disciplinary knowledge of the field of learning analytics while also building technical skills in applying statistical analysis to educational datasets. These courses included exercises in analyzing stakeholder sentiment on Common Core standards ([**ECI 586**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-586-introduction-to-learning-analytics)), understanding the value of quality data ([**ECI 587**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-587-machine-learning-in-education)), identifying patterns in topical research ([**ECI 588**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-588-text-mining-in-education)), and recognizing the power of social networks on learning potential ([**ECI 589**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-589-analyzing-learning-networks)). The experiences from these four courses were brought to bear during a [**summer data science conference**](https://github.com/jmhardaw/LDT-portfolio/blob/main/content/eci515-artifacts/ECI652_Internship_Summary.pdf) where I worked as part of a 40-person cohort charged to crack an automated text summarization challenge for government knowledge workers. This internship (also part of [**ECI 652**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-652-field-based-applications-of-learning-design-and-technology)) gave me tangible insights into multi-disciplined problem-solving that would be tough to replicate in the classroom. While this opportunity focused on exploring machine-learning algorithms to lessen the research burden on intelligence analysts, we also developed experience in knowledge graphs, recommender systems, and human-computer interface techniques. Taken holistically, these five courses instilled in me a recognition of the power of data to shape the design of insightful learning metrics while also providing methods to evaluate and select the proper technologies to enhance the student experience.

**Design**
With an eye towards personalizing learning for individuals, my three design courses delivered practical knowledge of the latest instructional technologies to enhance my understanding of which tools to use as well as how to apply them to develop meaningful curricula. Theoretical Foundations ([**ECI 517**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-517-theoretical-foundations-of-advanced-learning-environments)) allowed me to first explore what led me to education and then develop a personal theory of learning based on student growth being driven by their own agency in the transformation process. My constructivist tendencies were reinforced in [**ECI 516**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-516-design-and-evaluation-of-instructional-materials) as we explored the design of instructional materials to solve specific learning challenges. My background in military systems design and project analysis was useful in increasing my understanding of how best to design learning materials as a single, but critical element of an overarching instructional process model. Finally, in [**ECI 515**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-515-cultural-investigations-and-technical-representations-in-education), the prior course knowledge was filtered through a cultural lens which helped me recognize and apply teaching strategies to unlock the power of not only diverse student groups but also self-awareness.

**Leadership**
Organizational learning is paramount to surviving and thriving in the digital age. For me, this begins with honing digital and media literacy skills. The ubiquitous information environment requires students and their school leadership to recognize how dynamic the learning environment is in the 21st century. The burden of keeping pace with knowledge that “moves” was a key insight from [**ECI 511**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-511-introduction-to-learning-design-and-technology). This also includes arming learners with the critical thinking skills to discriminate between good and bad sources of information. With every student bringing a device to campus, the educational infrastructure must be planned with their learning requirements and security in mind. Insights into staff development, resource management, and facilities design were critical principles I took from [**ECI 518**](https://jmhardaw.github.io/LDT-portfolio/courses.html#eci-518-digital-learning-program-and-staff-development). These lessons will prepare me well to serve in either academia or industry where flexibility and strategic vision will enable organizations to evolve as the learning landscape changes.
