## Bio

I am returning to NCSU after enjoying 27 years as an Army intelligence officer. Having worked in both the information technology and analysis communities, I'm versed in data-driven inquiry, critical thinking, and leadership development. My goal in the LD&T master's program is to explore how digital learning tools can assist in discovering how students best receive instruction to improve learning outcomes. Through the program at NC State I plan to pursue educational and research opportunities on a path to becoming an instructional designer in the K-12 community, where I'll strive to create a challenging and engaging educational environment in which students become life-long scholars and learners.

Skills critical to enabling this goal include:

Communication\
Teamwork/Collaboration\
Visionary Leadership\
Valuing Learner Diversity\
Instructional Systems Design\
Curriculum Design\
Planning/Organization
