I‚Äôm currently in my second semester of an instructional design M.Ed. program at NC State University. One of the graduation requirements is to produce an online portfolio describing my coursework and projects. The portfolio will become a jumping off point for my professional life and a place where I can showcase my work to potential employers or peers that wish to collaborate. The initial requirements for the assignment were fairly basic: set up a webpage with a framework that I‚Äôd fill in as I progress through the program. I did all that in a couple of hours during my introductory course last summer. You can see that initial effort here: https://jmhardaw.wordpress.ncsu.edu/. Everybody say, ‚ÄúGood job, James.‚Äù üí™\nSeriously, though, it was a simple assignment. The site was built through Wordpress, using one of their many free themes. As a student, I have access to free webhosting through the university, hence the page residing on the NCSU.edu domain. I quickly recognized a potential challenge once I left school‚Ä¶would I have to move or recreate my site on another domain? Additionally, having used Wordpress for a couple of years on other projects, I know I will eventually get bored with the chosen theme while running into barriers to personalization. For this portfolio, I really want to make it mine and not scripted according to a finite set of theme boundaries. I don‚Äôt (yet) know much about HTML, so eventually I‚Äôm going to run into a creative wall limiting me to the defaults inherent to my chosen theme.\n\n While these thoughts bounced around my brain housing group, I began exploring the world of coding in ‚ÄòR.‚Äô As part of my grad program, I‚Äôm working on a Learning Analytics certificate comprised of four courses focused on various dimension of data science in the education field. The coding environment predominantly used in these courses is that of ‚ÄòR.‚Äô Per the R-Project homepage, R is an open-source language and coding environment for statistical computing and graphics. In addition to being able to create extensive visuals, it can publish almost effortlessly to a wide variety of formats including HTML. Entire books are authored online with ‚ÄòR‚Äô as well as many creative websites, most focused on using R in statistics. I decided to marry the portfolio requirement to learning a new coding language and here we are. I‚Äôm going to build a website, pretty much from scratch, in a language that I don‚Äôt yet understand. Good plan, James. ü§¶\n\nWatch and Learn\n\n Like I do with most things new, nerdy, and technical, I just dove in. Instructional manual? Nope. Ask questions? Who‚Äôs got time for that? I‚Äôm ready to produce now! Yeah‚Ä¶that mindset lost me a day with zero to show for it. Won‚Äôt bore you with the details of what I did wrong, exactly, but it was just about everything. Day 2 started with a search for someone what had already done this successfully. Wow, there are a lot of you out there! The video I found incredibly easy to watch and follow came from Dr.¬†Maria Tackett. She gave this presentation as part of the R-Ladies Baltimore meetup in the spring of 2021. The hour-long tutorial was perfect for a rookie like me to understand step-by-step how to begin my project. Her insights led me to choose the Distill package over the Blogdown/Hugo mashup due to simplicity. Distill is just easier and more straightforward. While I knew I‚Äôd be sacrificing some creative capabilities, I felt Distill gave me the best shot at seeing quickly how well I could use R to produce a portfolio sight to meet my needs. If you want to compare capabilities, visit the page of Dr.¬†Malcolm Barrett, a data scientist in Los Angeles, CA. He built his using the Blogdown package and a Hugo theme.\n\nThe Git Repo\n\n Before diving into a build, users need a spot to store or ‚Äúhost‚Äù their content. Many options are available as I referenced earlier with Wordpress sites, university-provided webhosting, etc. In the data science community, GitHub is a well-known, free code hosting and collaboration platform that allows you access to great work from other users. In addition to acting as a repository (or repo) for your data, you can view how others built their content at the code level. Jackpot. üé∞ The git repo for my site is here, but you can also see other projects I‚Äôm working as I have multiple repos. With a GitHub account, users have a way to move products from their desktop to a repo to update their site. This can be done directly through the RStudio desktop or a GitHub desktop application (my current method). With a home base established, let‚Äôs get to the build!\n\nThe Framework\nDistill gives users the basic build choice between a website or a blog, with each of these choices determining how the initial framework is set. That said, I‚Äôve discovered you can modify this somewhat if you decide after the fact that you want one vs the other or a little of both (like me). I went with the website and then added a blog page after the fact. This was easy to do‚Ä¶once I figured out how Distill builds its functional pages. The pages within a Distill website are called ‚Äúarticles‚Äù and are formatted differently than a blog page. The key to a Distill site is how each page is identified. Your base home page or ‚Äúindex‚Äù page will carry the ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù moniker, while other pages are either ‚Äúarticles‚Äù or ‚Äúlist‚Äù pages (blogs). The ‚Äúlist‚Äù pages connect to your individual blog ‚Äúposts.‚Äù\nI‚Äôll pause here to acknowledge some great resources I found that gave me some additional pointers to get the site off the ground. First was a blog article posted by Dr.¬†John Helveston on his personal webpage that was also built with the Distill package. That article was not only incredibly insightful, but it introduced me to The Distillery. This site exists to help users better understand how to employ the Distill package while also showcasing some examples of others‚Äô websites. Another great tool is the Distill for Markdown article hosted by RStudio. The base page explains how to create a Distill article and you can go to a dropdown menu for similar pages on creating websites and blogs. From these first few resources, I felt confident I could technically produce a site. But to make it unique? I needed ideas. Back to the Distillery I went and discovered some amazing examples feeding my need to set my site apart from the crowd. Below are the key designers that inspired me.\n\n\nThe first site that caught my eye was the homepage for Dr.¬†Joel Nitta, a project research associate out of Tokyo. His intro page is a very clean, but informative snapshot of who he is and what he does. As I soon learned, this style of landing page is quite common on Distill sites as it is built with the postcards package that integrates well with Distill. The package contains five distinct themes that allow the user a variety of layouts for their introduction page. Dr.¬†Nitta‚Äôs specific theme is ‚Äútrestles.‚Äù My ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù page took this theme, so you should see some similarities. For many sites, this bio page becomes their landing page or ‚Äúindex‚Äù page and is the first thing you see. I did this too for the first few iterations of my published site. Eventually I created a different landing page that scaled to my different interests and took my site a bit beyond just creating a digital portfolio for grad school. More on that later. The next site that caught my eye was that of Dr.¬†Andreas Handel, a Professor at the University of Georgia. His article on building a website in less than 30 minutes was filled with helpful tips, but he also had some great design in his projects and subscribe pages. On his blog, I saw a way to integrate user feedback and comments. Dr.¬†Handel went with the utteranc.es widget which conveniently links to his GitHub repo. For users to comment, though, they must log into their own GitHub accounts before commenting. I‚Äôm currently steering away from this as I don‚Äôt want to limit feedback to only data science folks. I ended up going with a disqus comment plug-in as it allows anyone to comment on my blog posts without first logging in. While this allows some anonymity, I‚Äôm ok with that if it reduces barriers to communication. I did have to set up a disqus user account, but it was free. Finally, the site of Dr.¬†Emi Tanaka, a university lecturer out of Australia, intrigued me mainly because of her unique landing page. I knew I wanted to stray from the standard bio page and hers was built on sections you could easily change giving the site less of a static feel. She also incorporated a right sidebar with an active twitter widget. If you scroll through my page, you‚Äôll see I took many of my ideas from a combination of what I found successfully employed on other sites.\nThe Content\nThe foundation of my site was built around three pages: bio, grad school coursework, and a blog. Completing the contents on these pages was enough to see the site ‚Äúlive‚Äù and get a sense for what was possible. These pages would also meet the basic requirements for my digital portfolio assignment. As referenced earlier, the design of my bio page was taken from Dr.¬†Nitta‚Äôs page, while my coursework and blog pages closely match what I saw on Dr.¬†Helvy‚Äôs teaching and blog pages. Additionally, my color scheme was taken from Dr.¬†Helvy as well. Eventually I will probably change that, but his colors work, so no rush! I knew I would need to expand my coursework effort to include a ‚Äúprojects‚Äù page. Dr.¬†Helvy has a great one as well. It‚Äôs unique in that it pulls data from a .csv file (spreadsheet) resident in his repo. Instead of updating the webpage every time a project is ready to showcase, I only update the spreadsheet and upload it to GitHub.\nThe ‚Äúveteran resource‚Äù page was one of my last adds before I designed the new landing page. I work with current and former service members on campus, and I wanted a single spot they could go to access resources applicable to a veteran in college. That will be a living page that gets updated often. The landing page was the toughest to engineer. I wanted an introductory page that dynamically brought the visitor into all the efforts I‚Äôm involved with while providing an opportunity to interact on a more personal level. Currently, that‚Äôs being served by the top banner, calendar events and social media widget, but it could grow. Dr.¬†Tanaka‚Äôs site was one of the few that had a distinct landing page separate from her bio/resume page. I found that inviting and copied some of her great ideas. Over time I added some small features like a visitor counter and a subscribe widget on the blog page. Fairly simple once I saw how others had integrated the code. Finally, it was time to make it live.\nDeploy\n\n Lots of options. Initially I chose the simplest which is to deploy straight from GitHub pages. Again, it‚Äôs free. You won‚Äôt get a sexy domain name as it‚Äôs basically the name of your git repo, but it works seamlessly. Another free option is to go through Netlify which gives you the ability to customize your domain name a little better than on GitHub. It will still contain a Netlify prefix though. Lastly, you can use a personal domain name that you‚Äôve purchased. This gives you the ultimate flexibility in naming convention because you own the site. There are ways to go directly between your hosting service (I use Bluehost) and your Git repo, but for me it was a bit simpler to use Netlify as a middleman between the two. Doing this could take up to 24 hours to go live the first time, but updates happen very quickly thereafter (minutes).\n\nWork Left to Do\nMy goal for the project was to deploy a digital portfolio built in ‚ÄòR‚Äô over the winter break. I‚Äôm happy to report that mission accomplished. I got introduced to ‚ÄòR‚Äô last summer, so it‚Äôs fair to say I‚Äôm no expert at this language. I‚Äôve also had to dabble a little bit in HTML and CSS. Thankfully, the ‚ÄòR‚Äô coding community is very open and willing to share good ideas with the noobs like me. It‚Äôs been frustrating at times, but I have yet to see a problem that someone else hasn‚Äôt already experienced and developed a solution. I‚Äôve also learned that themes aren‚Äôt evil! If you find one that suits you, then use it. Or start there and make it better. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the site grow as I get deeper into my grad school program. I‚Äôm also convinced there will be a time where I‚Äôll want to completely re-design it or add new capabilities‚Ä¶maybe after grad school‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs enough for this post as I‚Äôve got one last weekend of winter break. Time for the NerdyGI to find some snow! ‚ùÑÔ∏è\n\n\n\n",

The focus was on how to develop and implement a vision for integrating technology into an organization‚Äôs education or training and development program. We watched quite a few videos that, along with the reading, explained the challenges organizations faced when trying to transition to a more digital footprint for learning. The detractors usually came in one of three areas: mindset, skills, or behaviors. For an organization to effectively adopt a new operating model, such as digital learning, the people need to be ready for this change. Buy-in matters. Leadership should endeavor to ensure the workforce understands how the organization will improve with these changes. If a person doesn‚Äôt understand how the changes will make their job easier or more productive, they will fight learning any new skills during the transition. Another limiting factor is often individual skills. Especially for an older workforce that my not have grown up digital, learning tech skills can be intimidating. As part of the transition, leadership should plan for and resource training modules to ensure everyone can comfortably employ the new digital tools. And finally, leadership sets the example by modeling behaviors that reinforce the advantages of adopting new technology. Leaders must use the tools, whether its email calendars or a new project management system, if they expect the workforce to do the same. The goal should be for the technology to become a seamless part of effective operations, and not have your day-to-day tasks be driven by the capability of the tech.\n\n One of the better readings this week was an article on the Pillars of Digital Leadership, penned by Eric Sheninger. The article captured seven insights he took from transitioning his high school to a more digital learning environment. I liked the article so much, I grabbed a copy of his book, Digital Leadership: Changing Paradigms for Changing Times, which explains in greater detail how he was able to change the technology culture in his school.\n\nAssignments\n\n Our assignment this week was to create a short online professional training video. Camtasia was referenced as a tool used throughout the learning design community, so I invested in the software for this project. The price was very manageable and there is a good Mac version, which was great as that‚Äôs my OS of choice. Additionally, numerous sites exist that have short, but effective, instructional videos on how to use the software if you get stuck. For the assignment, I chose to create a video on building breakout rooms in Zoom. You can find my final version here. The video had to be at least 10 minutes in length, so that became my target. While the project wasn‚Äôt too complicated, it does take a bit of practice and trial & error to effectively use the highlighting tools while making the video. I got to work with employing transitions as well. In the end, it was probably ~4 hours of work to make a 10-minute video. Much of that was due to me learning the software and how my mic/speakers impacted the quality of the video. I built an outline and script for my speaking parts, which allowed me to focus most of my rehearsals on ensuring my voice matched with my on-screen walkthrough. While I won‚Äôt be winning any Academy Awards in the near future, I liked the final product. The key, though, was it showed me that content development/design is probably NOT my dream job. While it was fun to explore the software and see the final video in action, there was way too much detailed work and editing for just 10 minutes of product. But, I do have confidence now that I can do this when/if the need arises down the road.\n\nNext week? We talk design. See you soon!\n\n\n\n",

ECI 511, Intro to LDT, is the recommended first course for the program and for good reason. The compressed schedule is designed to give a thorough, but quick, overview of the 3 core disciplines within the field of LDT: Leadership, Design, and Digital Inquiry. Here in week 1, we focused on how the LDT field has been established historically mainly driven by the technological revolution.\nReading/Videos\nThe class material has a good mix of articles and videos to introduce us to how the field has evolved over the past 100 years. There is a major assignment each week and for this first week, my assignment was to establish this portfolio website. The intent is for me to use this portal to chart my progress through the program, displaying my work as well as what I‚Äôm learning by doing the work. The end state is to have a portfolio showing my progress in becoming a learning designer that could potentially be used as a launching point for my life after the program. Through this week‚Äôs class material, my key insights are below:\nTech changes to education came from outside the school house (government, military, industry)\nThe speed of tech evolution (capability/capacity) is always under-valued/appreciated\nTech‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúrevolutionize‚Äù learning has always been over-emphasized\nEducational institutions are generally slow to adopt new technology/methods\nHistorically, tech‚Äôs impact to learning has been on the margins (pencils/paper/blackboards becoming digitized), but we have yet to see a ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù in how we teach/learn.\nDiscussion\nFor our first discussion topic, each student was asked to provide an introduction and photo so we can better visualize who we‚Äôll be working with this semester. The introduction should Include current job role, goal or rationale for entering the Learning, Design, and Technology master‚Äôs program, and interests in the field. Finally, after perusing this week‚Äôs readings, we were asked to craft a personal definition of the instructional technology/instructional design field. The goal is to see how much our perceptions and or knowledge of the field change throughout the course, and we will have an opportunity to revisit the definition at the end of the semester to correct any misconceptions. Below is my intro to the class:\n\n Hello, fellow Wolfpackers! My name is James Hardaway and I‚Äôm new to the education and learning design field. I‚Äôm returning to NCSU after a bit of a detour as an Army officer. I will retire this week, so it‚Äôs fitting to come back to my roots as my military career began here with my graduation and commissioning back in 1994. I‚Äôve spent 27 years as an Army intelligence officer, so I‚Äôm versed in data-driven analysis, critical thinking, and leadership development. My goal in the LD&T master‚Äôs program is to explore how digital learning tools can assist in discovering how students receive instruction and learn. I‚Äôm a parent of a high school senior who is in his 10th school. To say we‚Äôve seen a wide variety of teaching methodologies is a huge understatement. These experiences have highlighted a gap (at least in public education) in how to determine a student‚Äôs learning path to best maximize outcomes for the individual. I want to play a role in developing tools (software/hardware) and designing curricula that bridge this gap.\nTo me, the instructional technology/instructional design field combines advances in multi-media educational instruments/aids with various teaching modalities to improve the learning experience.\n\nAssignments\n\n Our first graded assignment is to create a website framework that we‚Äôll be using for our digital program portfolio. The guidelines are fairly broad and allow us to use any tools we‚Äôre confident can enable us to build a site that demonstrates the skills and abilities we‚Äôve acquired throughout the program. The completed portfolio will be submitted as part of ECI 652, our final course. I have some experience with WordPress and building websites, so I began there. For this initial assignment, we are only required to develop the basic structure for the online portfolio. That effort resides here. I‚Äôm sure this site will evolve often and look much different by the time I complete the program.\n\n\n\n\n",
