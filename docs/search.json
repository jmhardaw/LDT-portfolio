This time\n            around my passion is education as I’m working to complete an\n            M.Ed. in Learning Design & Technology. My military\n            career was focused on analyzing information to inform\n            decision-makers. I’m now taking that experience and applying\n            it to the evolving field of learning technology. At a young\n            age, I was blessed with incredibly talented and selfless\n            teachers. My goal through this program is to develop tools\n            that will continue to enable great teachers to guide\n            students just as I was. From the K-12 community through\n            higher ed and into industry, my objective is to create\n            accessible and engaging educational spaces in which students\n            become lifelong scholars with an eye toward improving the\n            world around them.\n            Professional and research interests\n            include:\n            \n            Inquiry – Employing data science models to improve learning\n            metrics\n            \n            \n            Design – Integrating technology to personalize learning\n            \n            \n            Leadership – Strengthening digital literacy to enhance\n            organizational learning\n            \n            My primary goal as I transition to the next phase of my\n            journey is to make a positive change in the world of\n            learning. Whether that’s analyzing methods and outcomes,\n            assisting colleagues in integrating technology into their\n            curricula, or helping organizations transform into more\n            advanced learning environments, my passion is in education.\n            Whichever path I choose, I will base my educational\n            philosophy on sound learning theories that incorporate\n            creative design principles while integrating the most\n            effective technologies that I’ve been exposed to in NC\n            State’s Learning Design and Technology program. To achieve\n            this goal, I’ve structured my M.Ed. studies to focus on the\n            Inquiry strand of the program while building supporting\n            skills in Design and Digital Leadership. Half of my\n            coursework (5 courses) is directed at researching and\n            evaluating learning technology programs to better identify\n            metrics for student success. That strong technical\n            evaluation focus is reinforced by a broad knowledge of\n            applying instructional technologies to developing learning\n            programs (3 courses), and leading organizations through\n            digital transformation (2 courses). This coursework along\n            with the practical experience gained in the military and an\n            analytics lab internship has provided me with the\n            appropriate knowledge and confidence to apply data science\n            methods to improve learning design and technology\n            integration in K-12, post-secondary, and industry\n            educational environments.\n            Inquiry In the Spring of ’22, I complete\n            the coursework to receive a graduate certificate in Learning\n            Analytics. This program was comprised of 12 credit hours\n            over two consecutive semesters and focused on developing\n            disciplinary knowledge of the field of learning analytics\n            while also building technical skills in applying statistical\n            analysis to educational datasets. These courses included\n            exercises in analyzing stakeholder sentiment on Common Core\n            standards (ECI\n            586), understanding the value of quality data\n            (ECI\n            587), identifying patterns in topical research\n            (ECI\n            588), and recognizing the power of social\n            networks on learning potential (ECI\n            589). The experiences from these four courses\n            were brought to bear during a summer\n            data science conference where I worked as part\n            of a 40-person cohort charged to crack an automated text\n            summarization challenge for government knowledge workers.\n            This internship (also part of ECI\n            652) gave me tangible insights into\n            multi-disciplined problem-solving that would be tough to\n            replicate in the classroom. While this opportunity focused\n            on exploring machine-learning algorithms to lessen the\n            research burden on intelligence analysts, we also developed\n            experience in knowledge graphs, recommender systems, and\n            human-computer interface techniques. Taken holistically,\n            these five courses instilled in me a recognition of the\n            power of data to shape the design of insightful learning\n            metrics while also providing methods to evaluate and select\n            the proper technologies to enhance the student\n            experience.\n            Design With an eye towards personalizing\n            learning for individuals, my three design courses delivered\n            practical knowledge of the latest instructional technologies\n            to enhance my understanding of which tools to use as well as\n            how to apply them to develop meaningful curricula.\n            Theoretical Foundations (ECI\n            517) allowed me to first explore what led me to\n            education and then develop a personal theory of learning\n            based on student growth being driven by their own agency in\n            the transformation process. My constructivist tendencies\n            were reinforced in ECI\n            516 as we explored the design of instructional\n            materials to solve specific learning challenges. My\n            background in military systems design and project analysis\n            was useful in increasing my understanding of how best to\n            design learning materials as a single, but critical element\n            of an overarching instructional process model. Finally, in\n            ECI\n            515, the prior course knowledge was filtered\n            through a cultural lens which helped me recognize and apply\n            teaching strategies to unlock the power of not only diverse\n            student groups but also self-awareness.\n            Leadership Organizational learning is\n            paramount to surviving and thriving in the digital age. For\n            me, this begins with honing digital and media literacy\n            skills. The ubiquitous information environment requires\n            students and their school leadership to recognize how\n            dynamic the learning environment is in the 21st century. The\n            burden of keeping pace with knowledge that “moves” was a key\n            insight from ECI\n            511. This also includes arming learners with\n            the critical thinking skills to discriminate between good\n            and bad sources of information. With every student bringing\n            a device to campus, the educational infrastructure must be\n            planned with their learning requirements and security in\n            mind. Insights into staff development, resource management,\n            and facilities design were critical principles I took from\n            ECI\n            518. These lessons will prepare me well to\n            serve in either academia or industry where flexibility and\n            strategic vision will enable organizations to evolve as the\n            learning landscape changes.\n            \n             Resume Army Bio\n            \n            \n            \n            Education\n            \n            NC State University | MEd\n            in Learning Design & Technology | Expected\n            Graduation - Fall, 2022\n            \n            \n            US Army Command & General Staff College\n            | Master\n            of Military Arts & Sciences | 2008\n            \n            \n            Central Michigan University | MS\n            in Administration | 2007\n            \n            \n            NC State University | BS in Civil\n            Engineering | 1994\n            \n            \n            \n            Experience\n            \n            NC State\n            Laboratory for Analytic Sciences, North\n            Carolina | SCADS Student Intern | June - August\n            2022\n            \n            \n            NC\n            State Military and Veteran Services,\n            North Carolina | VA Work Study | July 2021 - May\n            2022\n            \n            \n            US\n            Army Futures Command, Virginia\n            | Information Portfolio Modernization Lead | July 2019 -\n            June 2021\n            \n            \n            US Army\n            Training and Doctrine Command,\n            Arizona | Instructor & Curriculum Designer |\n            August 2003 - May 2005\n            \n            \n            US\n            Army, Various Global Locales |\n            Intelligence Officer | September 1994 - September 2021\n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              James Hardaway\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                       Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       Google\n                      Scholar\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              My Goals\n              California-born, North Carolina-raised, and\n              Army-trained, I’m returning to my roots at NC State\n              University after enjoying 27 years as an Army intelligence\n              officer.

To\n              achieve this goal, I’ve structured my M.Ed. studies to\n              focus on the Inquiry strand of the program while building\n              supporting skills in Design and Digital Leadership. Half\n              of my coursework (5 courses) is directed at researching\n              and evaluating learning technology programs to better\n              identify metrics for student success. That strong\n              technical evaluation focus is reinforced by a broad\n              knowledge of applying instructional technologies to\n              developing learning programs (3 courses), and leading\n              organizations through digital transformation (2 courses).\n              This coursework along with the practical experience gained\n              in the military and an analytics lab internship has\n              provided me with the appropriate knowledge and confidence\n              to apply data science methods to improve learning design\n              and technology integration in K-12, post-secondary, and\n              industry educational environments.\n              Inquiry In the Spring of ’22, I\n              complete the coursework to receive a graduate certificate\n              in Learning Analytics. This program was comprised of 12\n              credit hours over two consecutive semesters and focused on\n              developing disciplinary knowledge of the field of learning\n              analytics while also building technical skills in applying\n              statistical analysis to educational datasets. These\n              courses included exercises in analyzing stakeholder\n              sentiment on Common Core standards (ECI\n              586), understanding the value of quality data\n              (ECI\n              587), identifying patterns in topical\n              research (ECI\n              588), and recognizing the power of social\n              networks on learning potential (ECI\n              589). The experiences from these four courses\n              were brought to bear during a summer\n              data science conference where I worked as\n              part of a 40-person cohort charged to crack an automated\n              text summarization challenge for government knowledge\n              workers. This internship (also part of ECI\n              652) gave me tangible insights into\n              multi-disciplined problem-solving that would be tough to\n              replicate in the classroom. While this opportunity focused\n              on exploring machine-learning algorithms to lessen the\n              research burden on intelligence analysts, we also\n              developed experience in knowledge graphs, recommender\n              systems, and human-computer interface techniques. Taken\n              holistically, these five courses instilled in me a\n              recognition of the power of data to shape the design of\n              insightful learning metrics while also providing methods\n              to evaluate and select the proper technologies to enhance\n              the student experience.\n              Design With an eye towards\n              personalizing learning for individuals, my three design\n              courses delivered practical knowledge of the latest\n              instructional technologies to enhance my understanding of\n              which tools to use as well as how to apply them to develop\n              meaningful curricula. Theoretical Foundations (ECI\n              517) allowed me to first explore what led me\n              to education and then develop a personal theory of\n              learning based on student growth being driven by their own\n              agency in the transformation process. My constructivist\n              tendencies were reinforced in ECI\n              516 as we explored the design of\n              instructional materials to solve specific learning\n              challenges. My background in military systems design and\n              project analysis was useful in increasing my understanding\n              of how best to design learning materials as a single, but\n              critical element of an overarching instructional process\n              model. Finally, in ECI\n              515, the prior course knowledge was filtered\n              through a cultural lens which helped me recognize and\n              apply teaching strategies to unlock the power of not only\n              diverse student groups but also self-awareness.\n              Leadership Organizational learning is\n              paramount to surviving and thriving in the digital age.\n              For me, this begins with honing digital and media literacy\n              skills. The ubiquitous information environment requires\n              students and their school leadership to recognize how\n              dynamic the learning environment is in the 21st century.\n              The burden of keeping pace with knowledge that “moves” was\n              a key insight from ECI\n              511. This also includes arming learners with\n              the critical thinking skills to discriminate between good\n              and bad sources of information. With every student\n              bringing a device to campus, the educational\n              infrastructure must be planned with their learning\n              requirements and security in mind. Insights into staff\n              development, resource management, and facilities design\n              were critical principles I took from ECI\n              518. These lessons will prepare me well to\n              serve in either academia or industry where flexibility and\n              strategic vision will enable organizations to evolve as\n              the learning landscape changes.\n              \n               Resume Army Bio\n              \n              \n              \n              Education\n              \n              NC State University | MEd\n              in Learning Design & Technology | Expected\n              Graduation - Fall, 2022\n              \n              \n              US Army Command & General Staff\n              College | Master\n              of Military Arts & Sciences | 2008\n              \n              \n              Central Michigan University | MS\n              in Administration | 2007\n              \n              \n              NC State University | BS in Civil\n              Engineering | 1994\n              \n              \n              \n              Experience\n              \n              NC\n              State Laboratory for Analytic\n              Sciences, North Carolina |\n              SCADS Student Intern | June - August 2022\n              \n              \n              NC\n              State Military and Veteran Services,\n              North Carolina | VA Work Study | July 2021 - May\n              2022\n              \n              \n              US\n              Army Futures Command,\n              Virginia | Information Portfolio Modernization\n              Lead | July 2019 - June 2021\n              \n              \n              US Army\n              Training and Doctrine Command,\n              Arizona | Instructor & Curriculum Designer |\n              August 2003 - May 2005\n              \n              \n              US\n              Army, Various Global Locales\n              | Intelligence Officer | September 1994 - September 2021\n              \n              \n            \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n      © 2022 James Hardaway \n      \n      Made with\n      ,\n      ,\n      and the \n      distill package\n      Last updated on November 13,\n      2022\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n  \n  ",

This\napproach, weighted heavily in data-informed decision-making, places\nemphasis on empowering students as they drive the pace and scope of\ntheir learning journey. Today’s digital learning networks are\nindividualized and networked, while also existing both locally and\nglobally. This educational environment requires learners to be as\ncomfortable in the digital world as they are in the physical classroom.\nThe course and artifact summaries below depict how I used these\nrealities as a blueprint to develop knowledge and skills in guiding\nK-12, post-secondary, and even industry education programs to realize\npositive individual and organizational growth through effective\ntechnology integration.\n\n\nWhile I frontloaded the Learning Analytics certificate courses into\nmy first fall and spring semesters, I attempted to spread the design and\nleadership courses across multiple semesters to better diversify my\npersonal learning network throughout the program. This allowed me to\ntake insights from design and leadership classes and apply them to my\ncore work on analytics and inquiry. As a result, my foundation in data\nscience was better informed by the challenges faced in developing and\ndelivering quality content for the modern digital classroom. To this\nend, my inquiry projects focused on exploring the challenges of critical\nthinking, digital and media literacy, evaluation metrics, and\ncommunication across learning networks. The key insights I’m taking from\nhow I organized my learning is that today’s education space is\noverwhelmingly digital, it’s social, and it’s evolving.\n\n\nThe digital nature of education is producing a ton of data. While\nthis can be overwhelming if an organization is unprepared, the LA\nprogram instilled a data science mindset to solve these types of\nchallenges. From identifying and collecting the right data to\nunderstanding its potential significance, and finally, to developing\nmodels to solve increasingly complex problems, my experience through the\ncore coursework and the summer internship provided multiple repetitions\nto engage these methods as well as develop relationships with more\nexperienced practitioners.\n\n\nParticipating in this program post-pandemic allowed me to benefit\nfrom many of my peers’ experiences in hybrid learning environments. From\nequipment and infrastructure shortfalls to learner anxieties about being\non camera, I got to hear firsthand how some districts/programs rose to\nthe occasion while others floundered. In both cases, not all students\nhad the same experiences as their peers next to them in class or online.\nThe digital divide is real and not just happening in rural communities.\nLast spring, I participated in the NC Education Datathon hosted at\nNC State by the Governor’s office and the Hunt Institute. That experience\nopened my eyes to the lack of digital reach and equity across our state.\nPart of that challenge is recognizing how technology, connectivity\ninfrastructure, and socioeconomics all combine to impact individual\nstudents very differently. District and state educational leaders must\ndevelop a strategic vision of how to apply resources to ensure each\nstudent has the same opportunities regardless of location or personal\nsituation.\n\n\nThe portfolio is depicted chronologically as I took the courses\nbeginning in the Summer of 2021. Each entry contains a brief description\nof the course purpose, expected outcomes, and requirements. Also\nincluded are key artifacts contributing to my learning goals as well as\nsome examples of additional classwork.\n\nECI 511: Introduction\nto Learning Design and Technology\n\n\nThis course provided an overview of the Learning, Design, and\nTechnology master’s program at NC State University and to the field of\ninstructional design and educational technology, with an investigation\nof relevant careers, important theories and models guiding practice, and\nnoteworthy research findings by area. Learning activities included\nreading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and\nindividual projects. Students were assessed through asynchronous\ndiscussions, online participation, and homework assignments.\n\nKey Artifact:\nAnnotated\nBibliography - Digital Literacy\n\nThis assignment was one of the final projects for my introduction to\nlearning design. The annotated bibliography helped develop my inquiry\nand research skills as it required me to evaluate the quality of each of\nthe selected resources. As we were allowed to select our own research\ntopic, I focused on how digital literacy impacts learning design\nmethodologies. My goal was to hone my skills at discriminating between\nrelevant, meaningful sources and those that were not. I chose to explore\nboth Google Scholar and the NC State library to increase the chances of\nlocating quality articles. Though the project scope was limited to only\nfive annotations, this assignment greatly helped in developing my\ninitial research interest in digital literacy. The main takeaway from\nthis review reinforced that students who are more interested in the\nlearning material, show a greater desire to increase their digital\nliteracy skills. While short, the review implied a link between quality\nlearning technology integration and digital literacy aptitude.\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nSummer II 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Julia\nMcKeown\nAdditional Coursework:\nZoom Training\nVideo\nProject\n- State Park Employee Training Program\n\nECI 517: Theoretical\nFoundations of Advanced Learning Environments\n\n\nThis course provided us with the distinctions and concepts necessary\nto apply various theories of learning, cognition, and instruction to\ntraditional and distance learning settings. This course introduced and\nillustrated the proper use of these tools in providing insights into\ndefining and solving problems. The emphasis was on the use of these\ntheories to solve realistic and relevant problems drawn from my personal\nexperience or from cases we studied. Learning activities included\nreading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and\nindividual projects.\n\n\nKey Artifact:\nFinal\nTheory Paper - Agency Drives Growth\n\nThis theory paper completed my 15-week journey to better understand\nwhich instructional design theories I would pull from to develop my\npersonal learning model. Early in the semester, I wrote my initial\nthoughts on learning, so this was a follow-up based on almost 4 months\nof instructional design theory from the past 100 years or so. This\ncourse presented opportunities to explore my own thoughts, feelings, and\nbiases on how teachers affect the relationship between their students\nand the institution of education. Beyond teaching students how to\nunderstand the world around them, educators shape individual\ntrajectories by reinforcing scholarship as a lifelong adventure most\noften occurring outside the traditional classroom. This paper reflects\nhow my views on instruction shifted from focusing on learning capability\nto a more systems perspective of how learners grow as their environment\nchanges. I’m firmly planted in the constructivist camp, which was seen\nthrough the learning network diagram I developed as well as the pillars\nof my learning theory: self-aware, ownership (agency), complexity,\nmulti-mode, and collaboration.\n\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Julia\nMcKeown\nAdditional Coursework:\nInitial\nLearning Theory Paper\nReflexive\nEssay - Theories of Learning & Instruction\nApplication\nEssay - An Intro to R\n\nECI 586: Introduction\nto Learning Analytics*\n\n\nLearning Analytics (LA) has emerged over the past decade as an\ninterdisciplinary field encompassing Learning (e.g. educational\ntechnology, learning and assessment sciences), Analytics\n(e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and Human-Centered Design\n(e.g. usability, participatory design). This course provided an overview\nof the field, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied\nexperience with widely adopted tools and techniques for working with and\nexploring data. As I gained experience in the collection, analysis, and\nreporting of data throughout the course, I became much better prepared\nto help educational organizations understand and improve learning and\nthe contexts in which learning occurs.\n\n\nKey Artifact:\nFinal\nProject - Benchmarking Fake News\n\nMy introduction to data science and programming culminated in this\nproject testing the ability of text mining algorithms to recognize\nmisinformation in media and classify those news sources accordingly.\nThis assignment challenged my notion of “fake news” as rarely is a news\narticle, regardless of source, all true or all false. Misinformation (a\nclearer description) is more nuanced and is usually captured in the\ncontext of what was left out, or small details that can’t be verified as\nfact. While mistruths can be found, the sentiment of articles is a\nbetter barometer of an article and potentially a media organization’s\nbiases. This assignment reinforced the importance of collecting good\ndata (sourcing), cleaning and ingesting the data effectively\n(wrangling), exploring the data to identify patterns (analyzing),\nclassifying the articles based on these patterns into specific\ncategories (modeling), and finally reporting data-based findings\n(communicating). Using these five basic steps in each case study and\nthis project instilled respect for the data science process to ensure my\nresults were repeatable, even if the data were to change.\n\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Shaun\nKellogg\nAdditional Coursework:\nCase Study:\nPredicting Student Achievement\nCase Study:\nIdentifying At-Risk Students\nShiny\nApp Exercise: Class Enrollment & Gender\nCase Study:\nPublic Sentiment & State Standards\n\nECI 587: Machine\nLearning in Education*\n\n\nMachine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the\nbehavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather\nthan dictated through rules written by hand. This class taught the\npractical side of machine learning for applications in mining\neducational data. We covered a wide range of learning algorithms that\ncan be applied to a variety of educational problems. In particular, we\ndiscussed topics such as decision trees, rule-based classification,\nsupport vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In addition\nto readings from the course textbook, the course had a heavy project\nfocus to develop practical skills.\n\n\nKey Artifact:\nFinal\nProject - Identifying Misinformation in the Media\n\nThis final machine learning project was the culmination of about a\nmonth of research and experimentation using a couple of software tools\nto explore the potential for automated machine learning tools to\nrecognize misinformation in online news media. Using a dataset of 6000\nnews articles, this study demonstrated how various textual features\ncould be extracted to build algorithms that learned to recognize fake\nnews. Since my data was labeled as either “fake” or “real” prior to\nmodeling, I used supervised learning to train the model on how to\nrecognize which category best fit the articles. In addition to exploring\nhow feature space drives model training, this project reinforced the\nimportance of data engineering prior to experimentation. I learned how\nto identify whether a dataset is contaminated with information that\ncould cause the algorithm to “overfit” the data delivering results that\nweren’t generalizable to broader contexts. While the technology was up\nto the task of identifying biased articles, the results were primarily\ndriven by dataset quality.\n\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Shiyan\nJiang\n\nECI 516: Design and\nEvaluation of Instructional Materials\n\n\nThis course introduces us to the systems approach to instructional\ndesign and provided introductory information and application of skills\nand techniques necessary in the analysis, design, development,\nimplementation, and evaluation of instruction (often referred to as the\nADDIE framework). These skills are particularly useful for efficient and\ncost-effective development of solutions to novel instructional problems.\nThe emphasis was on the development of materials-centered instruction\n(as opposed to teacher-mediated), that is, materials and resources that\nare developed to be the primary means by which instruction is delivered.\nContrasting views and perspectives of instructional design were also\nconsidered, such as those based on very different learning philosophies\n(such as objectivism and constructivism).\n\n\nKey Artifacts:\nNeeds\nAnalysis Proposal\n\nThis Needs Analysis Proposal explored the process of determining an\norganization’s performance gaps and then designing an assessment\nmethodology to capture insights into how best to decrease those gaps\nwithin the realities of time and budget. The paper discusses how to help\nan organization understand the difference between where it is and where\nit desires to be regarding specific performance goals. Once those\ntargets are set, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to highlight\nwhat’s in the realm of the possible within the given time and budget.\nOnce school leadership agrees on what’s feasible, a plan can be\nconstructed for resourcing and completing the needs analysis. This\nassignment reinforced the critical importance of identifying measurable\nperformance gaps prior to implementing a technology or organizational\nsolution. This process ensures that the right problems are being\nsolved.\nInstructional\nDesign Process Model\n\nFor this assignment, I designed an instructional design process model\nfor a non-profit organization, exploring the need for non-educational\nentities to develop learning programs for their staff. To achieve this,\nI had to first conduct a systems analysis of the organization and its\nprocesses for delivering services. The resultant performance gaps\ninformed the design management analysis detailing what needed to be\nlearned, trained, and certified to meet their stated value proposition.\nFinally, a plan for executing the training was designed to ensure there\nwas a regular feedback loop on how well the program was meeting its\ndesired results. This systematic approach ensured that as the\norganization grew or lost members, the systems would still function\nproperly as long as the training pipeline was enforced.\n\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nSpring 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Caitlin\nMcKeown\nAdditional Coursework:\nSystem\nAnalysis Paper\n\nECI 588: Text Mining\nin Education*\n\n\nThis introductory course to text mining was designed to prepare\nresearchers and practitioners to use data more efficiently, effectively,\nand ethically. This course provided us with an overview of text mining\nas an analytical approach, examples of its use in educational contexts,\nand applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As we\ngained experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data\nthroughout the course, we became better prepared help educational\norganizations understand and improve both online and blended learning\nenvironments. We develop practical skills in the collection, analysis,\nand reporting of text data form sources such as Learning Management\nSystems, social media, and other online sources. Our projects were\ncompleted using a programming approach with R, a popular free open\nsource software program for data science.\n\n\nKey Artifact:\nShort Text\nTopic Modeling\n\nThe Short Text Topic Modelling assignment culminated my work in this\ncourse by combining lessons on text mining, topic modeling, and\ncommunicating results in a creative way to help users visualize\nrelationships within the data. My research questions were driven by\nprevious text mining projects that relied on incredibly large datasets.\nWhile it’s understandable that intricate learning models require vast\ndata to train them, I was on the search for a method that could reduce\nthat workload on the front end and potentially open up additional,\nsmaller resources that had previously been overlooked. Instead of a data\nmodel consuming entire papers or articles, I wanted to test whether it\nwas possible to gain insights from key sentences or ideas within those\ndocuments. Turns out it can be done! Using article titles and taglines,\nI was able to generate quite accurate topic models charting technical\nresearch topics over time. My biggest challenges were finding the right\ndata set and model that I could employ coding in R. I was able to find\nboth, though there was only a single short text topic model designed to\nwork well in R. That was enough, though, to show this could be done. The\nend result is a technique that could save researchers time in executing\ntheir text mining queries and topic models. This exercise exposed me to\nmultiple databases that could be used for experiments but also\nhighlighted that it’s often better to curate your own data if you have\nspecific research questions that few have worked on in the past.\n\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nSpring 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Shiyan\nJiang\nAdditional Coursework:\nAssessing\nSentiment: #Python vs. #Rstats Tweets\nTopic\nModeling: Amazon Book Reviews\nWord Net\nAnalysis: Text Networks Predicting Wordle Success\n\nECI 589: Analyzing\nLearning Networks*\n\n\nAlthough social network analysis and its educational antecedents date\nback to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like\nTwitter and Facebook have raised awareness of and renewed interests in\nnetworks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues\nexpand in education, data collected by these educational technologies\nhas also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to\nteaching and learning. This introductory course was designed to prepare\neducation researchers and practitioners to apply network analysis to\nbetter understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which\nlearning occurs. This course provided us with an overview of social\nnetwork theory, examples of network analysis in educational contexts,\nand applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques.\n\n\nKey Artifact:\nSocial\nCapital & Network Diffusion\n\nThis short case study explored the changes in student attitudes about\nSTEM when interacting with other students. In this final regression\nanalysis, the attitudes of people with whom a student engages impact\ntheir attitudes as well. In this case, three students were grouped with\nstudents that had lower attitude scores, which in turn dropped their own\nscores. Similarly, two students had relationships with students that had\nhigher STEM attitude scores, raising their average STEM interest. That\nsaid, where a student starts (baseline score) is much more influential\nthan the people they engage with. This is a great study on friend groups\nand how they could influence attitudes based on the number of network\nties and the power of each individual relationship.\n\n\n\nSemester Completed:\nSpring 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Shaun\nKellogg\nAdditional Coursework:\nVisual\n& Numerical Description: School Administrator Centrality\nNetwork\nSubstructures: Comparing Out-degree Communications by Role in\nMOOC-Eds\nPredicting\nNetwork Phenomena: Collaboration Dependency on Trust & Gender for\nSchool Leaders\n\nECI 515: Cultural\nInvestigations and Technical Representations in Education\n\n\nThis course took an anthropological-historical look at applying media\nand technology as resources and instruments to develop cultural\nawareness of self and others and to understand diverse cultures. The\ntechnology tools and media introduced encouraged us to explore cultural\nidentity, values, and differences. The teaching strategies introduced\nare applicable across content areas and particularly relevant in social\nstudies, English, world languages, and the arts.\n\n\nKey Artifacts:\nMedia Analyis\non Climate Change\n\nA primary goal of this assignment was to show how cultural topics are\nportrayed differently in media across sources, thus educating that the\n“truth” is not black or white or found in a random tweet or meme, but\nrather open to broad interpretation. I chose the global warming debate\nas my topic, which really gained steam in the 1970s as large studies\nwere commissioned by organizations such as the US National Academy of\nSciences. The results of these studies were published in the late\n70s/early 80s leading to a broader awareness of the issues. This\nawareness soon drove policy changes to be better stewards of the\nenvironment and the debate was on! For this padlet, I choose to look at\nmedia from four sources: YouTube, Twitter, Google Scholar, and the\ninternet at large. From Google Scholar and the internet, I easily found\nsources for each of the three positions (real, neutral, myth). YouTube\nwas a little more challenging in that they have done a good job of\nremoving most videos citing misinformation on the topic. While all three\nsides could be found on Twitter as well, the debate on that medium was\noften quite heated and probably the most negative of the four I\nresearched.\nPersonal Identity Text\n\nIn this project, I created an identity text that reflects on the\nevolution of my cultural identity. This artifact reinforces how everyone\nbrings with them information from their background: nationality, people,\ntraditions, politics, language, religion, race, ethnicity, gender,\neconomy, and more. These cultural elements influence us as people and\nlikely as educators.\n\n\n\nSemester:\nFall 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Florence\nMartin\nAdditional Coursework:\nGlobal\nProject Plan: Government Accessibility\n\nECI 518: Digital\nLearning Program and Staff Development\n\n\nThis course comprised the study and application of principles related\nto digital learning program planning, facilities and resource\nmanagement, and staff development in K-12 settings. It was designed to\nhelp prepare future technology facilitators and directors to design,\ndevelop, and lead school and/or district technology programs across K-12\nlevels. Some lessons translate to higher education or industry\ntechnology planning, but the majority of readings and resources in this\ncourse were geared toward K-12.\n\n\nKey Artifact:\nHigh\nSchool Tech Helpdesk Curriculum\n\nThe Help Desk Curriculum was designed to teach students the technical\nskills of how to manage a student-run IT help desk for a middle or high\nschool. The curriculum includes student responsibilities, learning\nproducts, and overarching projects. The curriculum addresses both IT\ntechnical knowledge as well as help desk management skills. While the\ncourse is designed as a standalone semester course (15 weeks), it can\nalso be executed as a student club either during or after regular school\nhours. The club version would allow students to work at their own pace\nwhich may be more beneficial for students who already have the requisite\nskills in certain IT topics. This curriculum was designed for in-person\ninstruction, but it could be easily modified to accommodate either a\nhybrid or fully online model. Developing this course exposed some\npotential barriers to adoption including funding, equipment, Help Desk\nspace, internet capacity, and enough mentor teachers with the requisite\nIT supervisory skills. Many schools face at least one of these\nchallenges, so this assignment forced me to build flexibility into the\nplan for this resource.\n\n\n\nSemester:\nFall 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Mark\nSamberg\nAdditional Coursework:\nDigital\nAge Instructional Framework\nNCDLI\nRubric Review\n3D\nPrinter Makerspace Budget\n\nECI 652: Field-Based\nApplications of Learning Design and Technology\n\nThis course employed supervised opportunities to design, test, and\nrevise learning design and technology solutions in authentic,\nfield-based settings. Learning activities included reading assignments,\nprogram portfolio, internship or an individual design project.\n\n\nKey Artifacts:\nSCADS\nInternship Summary\n\nMy internship occurred over an 8-week period from June – August of\n2022. The Summer Conference on Applied Data Science is an annual\nworkshop hosted by the NC State University Laboratory for Analytic\nSciences. The overarching vision is to bring together industry,\nacademic, and government professionals to collaboratively attack a Grand\nChallenge in the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence\ndevelopment space. For this inaugural conference, the challenge was to\ndevelop a tailored daily report for government knowledge workers through\nautomated text summarization. I pursued this internship to explore the\nfields of educational technology and digital literacy, specifically to\nbetter understand how text mining and ML tools could decrease the burden\non learners. This project accomplished that while also allowing me to\nnetwork with the DoD and intelligence communities as I prepare for\nopportunities after grad school. While this project focused on finding a\nbetter text summarizer, I gained valuable insights into multiple\napplications to the field of learning design including literature\nreviews, evaluating student work, resource discovery, and knowledge\nmanagement.\nLD&T Digital Portfolio\n\nThis portfolio serves as the capstone project to my work in NC\nState’s Learning Design and Technology program. The highlighted\nartifacts reflect the skills and competencies gained in support of my\nprimary learning goals of inquiry, design, and digital leadership. While\nI prioritized the inquiry track, specifically focusing on research and\nanalysis skills, I also took several courses to expand my knowledge in\ntechnology integration (design) and educational organization\ntransformation (leadership). Lastly, this portfolio, written in R using\nthe Distill package, serves as a practical exercise in applying the\ncoding techniques I gleaned from the Learning Analytics certification\nprogram.\n\n\n\nSemester:\nFall 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Julia\nMcKeown\n\n\n\n\n",
