This time\n            around my passion is education as I’m working to complete an\n            M.Ed. in Learning Design & Technology. My military\n            career was focused on analyzing information to inform\n            decision-makers.

At a young\n            age I was blessed with incredibly talented and selfless\n            teachers.

This online course\ndelivered all learning materials. activities, and assignments, through\nMoodle,\na secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was\ncompletely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting\nrequirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design\nprojects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This\ncourse consisted of 5 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended\nthe following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday.\nStudents were assessed through asynchronous discussions, online\nparticipation, and homework assignments. Teaching will involve\ninteractive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working\non practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming\nexperience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data\nanalytics.\n\nSemester Completed:\nSummer II 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Julia\nMcKeown\nArtifacts:\nZoom Training\nVideo\nZoom\nTraining Video Script\nProject\n- State Park Employee Training Program\nAnnotated\nBibliography - Digital Literacy\n\nECI 517: Theoretical\nFoundations of Advanced Learning Environments\n\n\nThis course provided students with the distinctions and concepts\nnecessary to apply various theories of learning, cognition, and\ninstruction to traditional and distance learning settings. These\ntheories are tools that educators, administrators, instructors,\ncounselors, parents, and many others can use to make their endeavors\nmore productive and useful. This course introduced and illustrated the\nproper use of these tools in providing insights into defining and\nsolving problems. The emphasis was on the use of these theories to solve\nrealistic and relevant problems drawn from my personal experience or\nfrom cases we studied. This online course delivered all learning\nmaterials, activities, and assignments, through Moodle,\na secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was\ncompletely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting\nrequirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design\nprojects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This\ncourse consisted of 15 course weeks.

In response, Learning Analytics (LA) has\nemerged over the past decade as an interdisciplinary field encompassing\nLearning (e.g. educational technology, learning and assessment\nsciences), Analytics (e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and\nHuman-Centered Design (e.g. usability, participatory design). This\ncourse provided an overview of the field, examples of its use in\neducational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools\nand techniques for working with and exploring data. As students gained\nexperience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout\nthe course, they were better prepared to help educational organizations\nunderstand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning\noccurs.\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Shaun\nKellogg\nArtifacts:\nCase Study:\nPredicting Student Achievement\nCase Study:\nIdentifying At-Risk Students\nShiny\nApp Exercise: Class Enrollment & Gender\nCase Study:\nPublic Sentiment & State Standards\nFinal\nProject: Benchmarking Fake News\n\nECI 587: Machine\nLearning in Education\n\n\nMachine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the\nbehavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather\nthan dictated through rules written by hand. This class taught the\npractical side of machine learning for applications in mining\neducational data. There was a heavy project focus, and upon completing\nthe course, we were fully prepared to attack new problems using machine\nlearning in the field of education. We covered a wide range of learning\nalgorithms that can be applied to a variety of educational problems. In\nparticular, we discussed topics such as decision trees, rule-based\nclassification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and\nclustering. In addition to readings from the course textbook, we had\nadditional readings from research articles that were distributed on Moodle.\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Shiyan\nJiang\nArtifacts:\nFinal\nProject: Identifying Misinformation in the Media\n\nECI 516: Design and\nEvaluation of Instructional Materials\n\n\nThis course introduces students to the systems approach to\ninstructional design and provides introductory information and\napplication of skills and techniques necessary in the analysis, design,\ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation of instruction (often\nreferred to as the ADDIE framework). These skills are particularly\nuseful for efficient and cost-effective development of solutions to\nnovel instructional problems. The emphasis is on the development of\nmaterials-centered instruction (as opposed to teacher-mediated), that\nis, materials and resources that are developed to be the primary means\nby which instruction is delivered. Contrasting views and perspectives of\ninstructional design will be considered, such as those based on very\ndifferent learning philosophies (such as objectivism and\nconstructivism). This online course delivered all learning materials,\nactivities, and assignments, through Moodle,\na secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was\ncompletely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting\nrequirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design\nprojects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This\ncourse consisted of 15 course weeks.

Among these new data sources,\nunstructured data such as text represents a significant share. This\nintroductory course to text mining is designed to prepare researchers\nand practitioners to use this data more efficiently, effectively, and\nethically. This course will provide students with an overview of text\nmining as an analytical approach, examples of its use in educational\ncontexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and\ntechniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis,\nand reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better\nprepared help educational organizations understand and improve both\nonline and blended learning environments. Students develop practical\nskills in the collection, analysis, and reporting of text data form\nsources such as Learning Management Systems, social media, and other\nonline sources. Students complete projects using a programming approach\nwith R, a popular free open source software program for data science, or\nusing non-programming point-and-click tools (i.e., SAS Visual Text\nAnalytics or Tableau).\n\nSemester Completed:\nSpring 2022\nInstructor:\nDr. Shiyan\nJiang\nArtifacts:\nAssessing\nSentiment: #Python vs. #Rstats Tweets\nTopic\nModeling: Amazon Book Reviews\nWord Net\nAnalysis: Text Networks Predicting Wordle Success\nFinal\nProject: Short Text Topic Modeling\n\nECI 589: Analyzing\nLearning Networks\n\n\nAlthough social network analysis and its educational antecedents date\nback to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like\nTwitter and Facebook have raised awareness of and renewed interests in\nnetworks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues\nexpand in education, data collected by these educational technologies\nhas also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to\nteaching and learning.
