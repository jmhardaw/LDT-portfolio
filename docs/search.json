This online course delivered all learning materials. activities, and assignments, through Moodle, a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was completely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This course consisted of 5 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended the following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday. Students were assessed through asynchronous discussions, online participation, and homework assignments. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.\n\nSemester Completed:\nSummer II 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Julia McKeown\nArtifacts:\nZoom Training Video\nZoom Training Video Script\nProject - State Park Employee Training Program\nAnnotated Bibliography - Digital Literacy\n\nECI 517: Theoretical Foundations of Advanced Learning Environments\n\n\nThis course provided students with the distinctions and concepts necessary to apply various theories of learning, cognition, and instruction to traditional and distance learning settings. These theories are tools that educators, administrators, instructors, counselors, parents, and many others can use to make their endeavors more productive and useful. This course introduced and illustrated the proper use of these tools in providing insights into defining and solving problems. The emphasis was on the use of these theories to solve realistic and relevant problems drawn from my personal experience or from cases we studied. This online course delivered all learning materials, activities, and assignments, through Moodle, a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was completely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This course consisted of 15 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended the following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday.\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Julia McKeown\nArtifacts:\nInitial Learning Theory Paper\nReflexive Essay - Theories of Learning & Instruction\nApplication Essay - An Intro to R\nFinal Theory Paper - Agency Drives Growth\n\nECI 586: Introduction to Learning Analytics\n\n\nAs the use of digital resources continues expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. In response, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged over the past decade as an interdisciplinary field encompassing Learning (e.g. educational technology, learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. usability, participatory design). This course provided an overview of the field, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques for working with and exploring data. As students gained experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they were better prepared to help educational organizations understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Shaun Kellogg\nArtifacts:\nCase Study: Predicting Student Achievement\nCase Study: Identifying At-Risk Students\nShiny App Exercise: Class Enrollment & Gender\nCase Study: Public Sentiment & State Standards\nFinal Project: Benchmarking Fake News\n\nECI 587: Machine Learning in Education\n\n\nMachine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. This class taught the practical side of machine learning for applications in mining educational data. There was a heavy project focus, and upon completing the course, we were fully prepared to attack new problems using machine learning in the field of education. We covered a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of educational problems. In particular, we discussed topics such as decision trees, rule-based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In addition to readings from the course textbook, we had additional readings from research articles that were distributed on Moodle.\n\nSemester Completed:\nFall 2021\nInstructor:\nDr. Shiyan Jiang\nArtifacts:\nFinal Project: Identifying Misinformation in the Media\n\n\n\n",
