Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the web. This portfolio site is being built as part of a class requirement for the masters program I am just now beginning at NC State. Over the next 2 years or so, I will use this landing spot to drop insights and artifacts from my journey through [Learning Design & Technology](https://online-distance.ncsu.edu/program/master-of-science-in-learning-design-and-technology/) studies at the [NCSU College of Education](https://ced.ncsu.edu/). Wish me luck!!
