## Executive Overview

<p>The portfolio below captures the coursework I've completed toward developing skills in a systems approach to instructional design. This approach, weighted heavily in data-informed decision-making, places emphasis on empowering students as they drive the pace and scope of their learning journey. Today's digital learning networks are individualized and networked, while also existing both locally and globally. This educational environment requires learners to be as comfortable in the digital world as they are in the physical classroom. The course and artifact summaries below depict how I used these realities as a blueprint to develop knowledge and skills in guiding K-12, post-secondary, and even industry education programs to realize positive individual and organizational growth through effective technology integration.

</p>

<p>While I frontloaded the Learning Analytics certificate courses into my first fall and spring semesters, I attempted to spread the design and leadership courses across multiple semesters to better diversify my personal learning network throughout the program. This allowed me to take insights from design and leadership classes and apply them to my core work on analytics and inquiry. As a result, my foundation in data science was better informed by the challenges faced in developing and delivering quality content for the modern digital classroom. To this end, my inquiry projects focused on exploring the challenges of critical thinking, digital and media literacy, evaluation metrics, and communication across learning networks. The key insights I'm taking from how I organized my learning is that today's education space is overwhelmingly digital, it's social, and it's evolving.

</p>

<p>The digital nature of education is producing a ton of data. While this can be overwhelming if an organization is unprepared, the LA program instilled a data science mindset to solve these types of challenges. From identifying and collecting the right data to understanding its potential significance, and finally, to developing models to solve increasingly complex problems, my experience through the core coursework and the summer internship provided multiple repetitions to engage these methods as well as develop relationships with more experienced practitioners.

</p>

<p>Participating in this program post-pandemic allowed me to benefit from many of my peers' experiences in hybrid learning environments. From equipment and infrastructure shortfalls to learner anxieties about being on camera, I got to hear firsthand how some districts/programs rose to the occasion while others floundered. In both cases, not all students had the same experiences as their peers next to them in class or online. The digital divide is real and not just happening in rural communities. Last spring, I participated in the datathon hosted by NCSU and the Governor's office. That experience opened my eyes to the lack of digital reach and equity across our state. Part of that challenge is recognizing how technology, connectivity infrastructure, and socioeconomics all combine to impact individual students very differently. District and state educational leaders must develop a strategic vision of how to apply resources to ensure each student has the same opportunities regardless of location or personal situation.

</p>

<p>The portfolio is depicted chronologically as I took the courses beginning in the Summer of 2021. Each entry contains a brief description of the course purpose, expected outcomes, and requirements. Also included are key artifacts contributing to my learning goals as well as some examples of additional classwork.

## [ECI 511: Introduction to Learning Design and Technology](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20511)

::: float-left
<img src="images/LDTVenn.jpg" width="200px"/>

This course provided an overview of the Learning, Design, and Technology master's program at NC State University and to the field of instructional design and educational technology, with an investigation of relevant careers, important theories and models guiding practice, and noteworthy research findings by area. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. Students were assessed through asynchronous discussions, online participation, and homework assignments.

<p>

**Key Artifact**:

[Annotated Bibliography - Digital Literacy](https://github.com/jmhardaw/LDT-portfolio/blob/main/content/eci511-artifacts/ECI511-annotated-bibliography.pdf)

[<img src="images/eci511_artifact1.png" width="200"/>](https://github.com/jmhardaw/LDT-portfolio/blob/main/content/eci511-artifacts/ECI511-annotated-bibliography.pdf)

This assignment was one of the final projects for my introduction to
learning design. The annotated bibliography helped develop my inquiry and research skills as it required me to evaluate the quality of each of the selected resources. As we were allowed to select our own research topic, I focused on how digital literacy impacts learning design methodologies. My goal was to hone my skills at discriminating between relevant, meaningful sources and those that were not. I chose to explore both Google Scholar and the NC State library to increase the chances of locating quality articles. Though the project scope was limited to only five annotations, this assignment greatly helped in developing my initial research interest in digital literacy. The main takeaway from this review reinforced that students who are more interested in the learning material, show a greater desire to increase their digital literacy skills. While short, the review implied a link between quality learning technology integration and digital literacy aptitude.

## [ECI 517: Theoretical Foundations of Advanced Learning Environments](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20517)

::: float-left
<img src="images/theory.jpg" width="200px"/>

This course provided us with the distinctions and concepts necessary to apply various theories of learning, cognition, and instruction to traditional and distance learning settings. This course introduced and illustrated the proper use of these tools in providing insights into defining and solving problems. The emphasis was on the use of these theories to solve realistic and relevant problems drawn from my personal experience or from cases we studied. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects.

**Key Artifact**:

[Final Theory Paper - Agency Drives Growth](https://github.com/jmhardaw/LDT-portfolio/blob/main/content/eci517-artifacts/ECI517-final-theory-paper.pdf)

[![](images/eci517_artifact1.png){width="200"}](https://github.com/jmhardaw/LDT-portfolio/blob/main/content/eci517-artifacts/ECI517-final-theory-paper.pdf)

This theory paper completed my 15-week journey to better understand which instructional design theories I would pull from to develop my personal learning model. Early in the semester, I wrote my initial thoughts on learning, so this was a follow-up based on almost 4 months of instructional design theory from the past 100 years or so. This course presented opportunities to explore my own
thoughts, feelings, and biases on how teachers affect the relationship between their students and the institution of education. Beyond teaching students how to understand the world around them, educators shape individual trajectories by reinforcing scholarship as a lifelong adventure most often occurring outside
the traditional classroom. This paper reflects how my views on instruction shifted from focusing on learning capability to a more systems perspective of how learners grow as their environment changes. I'm firmly planted in the constructivist camp, which was seen through the learning network diagram I developed as well
as the pillars of my learning theory: self-aware, ownership (agency), complexity, multi-mode, and collaboration.

Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. This class taught the practical side of machine learning for applications in mining educational data. There was a heavy project focus, and upon completing the course, we were fully prepared to attack new problems using machine learning in the field of education. We covered a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of educational problems. In particular, we discussed topics such as decision trees, rule-based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In addition to readings from the course textbook, we had additional readings from research articles that were distributed on [Moodle](https://delta.ncsu.edu/learning-technology/instructional-tools/moodle/).

## [ECI 516: Design and Evaluation of Instructional Materials](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20516)

::: float-left
<img src="images/school-venn.png" width="200px"/>

This course introduces students to the systems approach to instructional design and provides introductory information and application of skills and techniques necessary in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of instruction (often referred to as the ADDIE framework). These skills are particularly useful for efficient and cost-effective development of solutions to novel instructional problems. The emphasis is on the development of materials-centered instruction (as opposed to teacher-mediated), that is, materials and resources that are developed to be the primary means by which instruction is delivered. Contrasting views and perspectives of instructional design will be considered, such as those based on very different learning philosophies (such as objectivism and constructivism). This online course delivered all learning materials, activities, and assignments, through [Moodle](https://delta.ncsu.edu/learning-technology/instructional-tools/moodle/), a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was completely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This course consisted of 15 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended the following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday.
