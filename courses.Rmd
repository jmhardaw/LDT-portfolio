<img src="images/LDTVenn.jpg" width="200px"/>

This course provided an overview of the Learning, Design, and Technology master's program at North Carolina State University and to the field of instructional design and educational technology, with an investigation of relevant careers, important theories and models guiding practice, and noteworthy research findings by area. This online course delivered all learning materials. activities, and assignments, through [Moodle](https://delta.ncsu.edu/learning-technology/instructional-tools/moodle/), a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was completely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This course consisted of 5 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended the following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday. Students were assessed through asynchronous discussions, online participation, and homework assignments. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.

## [ECI 517: Theoretical Foundations of Advanced Learning Environments](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20517)

::: float-left
<img src="images/theory.jpg" width="200px"/>

This course provided students with the distinctions and concepts necessary to apply various theories of learning, cognition, and instruction to traditional and distance learning settings. These theories are tools that educators, administrators, instructors, counselors, parents, and many others can use to make their endeavors more productive and useful. This course introduced and illustrated the proper use of these tools in providing insights into defining and solving problems. The emphasis was on the use of these theories to solve realistic and relevant problems drawn from my personal experience or from cases we studied. This online course delivered all learning materials, activities, and assignments, through [Moodle](https://delta.ncsu.edu/learning-technology/instructional-tools/moodle/), a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was completely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This course consisted of 15 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended the following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday.

As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. In response, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged over the past decade as an interdisciplinary field encompassing Learning (e.g. educational technology, learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. usability, participatory design). This course provided an overview of the field, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques for working with and exploring data. As students gained experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they were better prepared to help educational organizations understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.

Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. This class taught the practical side of machine learning for applications in mining educational data. There was a heavy project focus, and upon completing the course, we were fully prepared to attack new problems using machine learning in the field of education. We covered a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of educational problems. In particular, we discussed topics such as decision trees, rule-based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In addition to readings from the course textbook, we had additional readings from research articles that were distributed on [Moodle](https://delta.ncsu.edu/learning-technology/instructional-tools/moodle/).

## [ECI 516: Design and Evaluation of Instructional Materials](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20516)

::: float-left
<img src="images/school-venn.png" width="200px"/>

This course introduces students to the systems approach to instructional design and provides introductory information and application of skills and techniques necessary in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of instruction (often referred to as the ADDIE framework). These skills are particularly useful for efficient and cost-effective development of solutions to novel instructional problems. The emphasis is on the development of materials-centered instruction (as opposed to teacher-mediated), that is, materials and resources that are developed to be the primary means by which instruction is delivered. Contrasting views and perspectives of instructional design will be considered, such as those based on very different learning philosophies (such as objectivism and constructivism). This online course delivered all learning materials, activities, and assignments, through [Moodle](https://delta.ncsu.edu/learning-technology/instructional-tools/moodle/), a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. The course was completely asynchronous, meaning students had no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning activities included reading assignments, design projects, videos, discussion forums, and individual projects. This course consisted of 15 course weeks. Each unit began on Monday and ended the following Sunday. Assignments were due by midnight on Sunday.

## [ECI 588: Text Mining in Education](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20588)

::: float-left
<img src="images/bigrams.png" width="200px"/>

As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. Among these new data sources, unstructured data such as text represents a significant share. This introductory course to text mining is designed to prepare researchers and practitioners to use this data more efficiently, effectively, and ethically. This course will provide students with an overview of text mining as an analytical approach, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments. Students develop practical skills in the collection, analysis, and reporting of text data form sources such as Learning Management Systems, social media, and other online sources. Students complete projects using a programming approach with R, a popular free open source software program for data science, or using non-programming point-and-click tools (i.e., SAS Visual Text Analytics or Tableau).

## [ECI 589: Analyzing Learning Networks](http://catalog.ncsu.edu/search/?P=ECI%20589)

::: float-left
<img src="images/school-network.png" width="200px"/>

Although social network analysis and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have raised awareness of and renewed interests in networks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, data collected by these educational technologies has also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning. This introductory course is designed to prepare education researchers and practitioners to apply network analysis to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. This course provides students with an overview of social network theory, examples of network analysis in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared to help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments.
